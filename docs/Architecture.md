# Overview and Architecture

Our autoscaler is composed of several interrelated components:

## Event-Driven Autoscaler Core (Python Operator):
- Uses Kopf (or a custom Python script) to monitor Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and event sources.
- Integrates with Kubernetesâ€™ Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for native scaling.
- Supports zero-scale (scaling deployments down to 0) and scaled jobs (batch/CronJobs).
- Responsible for making scaling decisions based on event data and metrics.
- Utilizes a state machine to manage the scaling process and ensure consistency.

## Multiple Event Sources & Extensibility:
- Built-in support for RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, Webhooks, and Kafka.
- A plugin system (based on a common Python interface) lets you add custom event sources easily.
- Event sources are configured using a standardized format, allowing for easy addition and removal of sources.

## Security & Production Hardening:
- Implements Kubernetes RBAC (using ServiceAccounts, Roles, and RoleBindings), uses Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive credentials, and integrates with AWS IAM (via IRSA on EKS or similar).
- Leader election, retries with exponential backoff, and failover ensure that only one autoscaler instance makes decisions at a time.
- Supports encryption of sensitive data and secure communication between components.

## Monitoring & Metrics:
- Exposes Prometheus metrics (using the prometheus_client library) so that you can monitor performance.
- Integrates with Grafana for dashboards.
- Provides detailed metrics on scaling decisions, event processing, and system performance.

## AI-Based Predictive Scaling and Anomaly Detection:
- Uses a machine learning model (e.g., a Random Forest regressor) trained on historical metrics (CPU, memory, and event counts) to predict the number of replicas.
- Anomaly detection (using Isolation Forest) automatically adjusts scaling when unusual conditions are detected.
- Automatic mitigation strategies adjust the replica count based on defined thresholds.
- Supports model retraining and updating to adapt to changing workloads.

## Manual Override and Multi-Tenant / Multi-Cluster Support:
- A REST API (built with FastAPI) and a React-based Web UI dashboard let users manually override scaling decisions.
- Scaling configurations can be defined per tenant/namespace and the autoscaler can control workloads across multiple Kubernetes clusters.
- Supports multi-tenancy through the use of Kubernetes namespaces and RBAC.

## CLI Tool:
- A command-line tool (using Click) to manage scaling configurations, list event sources, and manually trigger scaling.
- Provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing autoscaler configurations.

## Web UI Dashboard:
- A React dashboard with real-time updates via WebSockets (using FastAPI Socket.IO integration) displays metrics and allows manual override.
- Offers a user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing autoscaler configurations.
